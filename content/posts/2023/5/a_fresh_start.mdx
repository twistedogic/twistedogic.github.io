## The layoffs

It is happening everywhere, in tech, in banks, in startups. On the bright side,
most of the people I know who got layoff have find new roles, maybe better
than the one before. For the ones who "survived", it is not easy too. It is
a rough time for all of us.

## What can you do about it?

Not much. It is an unpopular opinion. It is just like refactoring instead of
code, it is a company or organization. As a developer you refactor code when you
want improve your code base because you expect the life span of your software to
be longer. You will not maintain a piece of code that you only use once. It is
all for the longer term.

From [Wikiepdia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring)

> In computer programming and software design, code refactoring is the process of restructuring existing computer code—changing the factoring—without changing its external behavior. Refactoring is intended to improve the design, structure, and/or implementation of the software (its non-functional attributes), while preserving its functionality.

Most of the people would worry about the layoffs. It is brutal.
However, refactoring is sometime necessary. The cause of it may be bad decisions
by management or change of context (environment).

Worrying about things that is out of your control,
is just like introducing a global variable into a function. It makes thing
complicated. Instead of being a function in an organization worry about
refactoring, be a developer of your life :)

## So why start a blog?

From time to time, I need to remind myself why I love software engineering. I
love building simple application (less refactoring). This blog is built with
`nextjs`, `contentlayer`, `tailwindcss` and `mdx`
([source](https://github.com/twistedogic/twistedogic.github.io)). Learning about them was an awesome
experience. This blog is a sandbox for me to experiment with things. Also, as a
way to organize my thoughts and practice writing words / code for humans.

## What next?

Some tutorials, some ideas and some random thoughts.
